    "fullText": "NEIL PARROTT HOLDS FUNDRAISER WITH DISGRACED FORMER TRUMP-NOMINEE, STEPHEN MOORE\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\nOCTOBER 21, 2024\nCONTACT: CHANDLER@APRIL4CONGRESS.COM \nGaithersburg, MD – In a recent social media post, Neil Parrott invited his supporters to a high-dollar fundraiser in Potomac with Stephen Moore, a controversial economist with a history of financial scandals and offensive remarks about women. Moore, who was nominated by former President Trump to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, ultimately withdrew his nomination after facing widespread criticism over his financial misconduct and inflammatory comments.\n\nReports revealed that Moore had underpaid alimony for years, even after a judge reprimanded him for failing to meet his obligations. In 2012, he was found in contempt of court for owing $300,000 in alimony and settlement money to his ex-wife. On top of these legal troubles, Moore was pursued by the IRS for $75,000 in unpaid taxes. Key Republican senators, including Susan Collins, Joni Ernst, and Richard Shelby, expressed serious concerns. Collins cited Moore’s “troubling writings about women,” while Shelby remarked on Moore’s unpaid taxes: “He better pay ’em!”\n\nMore disturbing is Moore’s track record of offensive comments on women. Speaking on the Violence Against Women Act included in the 1994 crime bill, Moore wrote, “Probably the most objectionable pork in the entire legislation is the $1.8 billion earmarked for Sen. Joe Biden’s ‘Violence Against Women Act.’ That act sets up gender sensitivity programs for judges and police; classifies assaults against women as ‘hate crimes’ or civil rights offenses, and passes out millions of dollars to women’s groups for ‘rape education’ and a smorgasbord of other programs.”\n\nOver the course of the campaign, April McClain Delaney has alerted voters of Neil Parrott’s harmful positions on issues impacting women, specifically his opposition to protections for victims of domestic violence. Neil Parrott was one of just four in the House of Delegates to vote against repealing the spousal defense for rape and sexual assault victims, stating, “I mean, you just pat them in the wrong way, they take it sexually inappropriately. That’s marriage.” Parrott was also one of two who voted against implementing age-appropriate curriculum on the awareness and prevention of sexual abuse and assault.   \n\nParrott’s association with Stephen Moore raises further concerns about his commitment to middle-class and low-income Marylanders. Moore, an outspoken critic of Social Security, has called the program a “Ponzi scheme” and dedicated his career to slashing Social Security and taxes for billionaires. Once again, Parrott’s own record mirrors Moore’s: he’s proposed raising the retirement age, forcing millions of hardworking Americans to delay their well-earned benefits, and in the Maryland legislature, consistently voted against measures that would have supported low-income seniors, including subsidies for assisted living and increased food stamp benefits. \n\n###",
