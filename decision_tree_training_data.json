In a recent social media post, Parrott falsely claimed that Rep. Raskin opposed aid to Israel, using an of Raskin with McClain Delaney from her recent endorsement.\n\nApril McClain Delaney strongly condemned the timing and tone of Parrott’s attack:\n\n“This is an outrageous smear against a Jewish Congressman, deliberately posted on Yom Kippur when Neil Parrott knew Jamie Raskin could not respond. And yet Neil Parrott launched his smear attack anyway,” said April McClain Delaney. “These are gutter tactics from an extremist who has been ranked as one of the least effective members of the Maryland legislature. It is no surprise given his scurrilous behavior.”\n\nNeil Parrott, the Republican candidate for Maryland’s 6th Congressional District, has faced previous criticism for his controversial positions on issues related to Israel and antisemitism. In 2020, he was one of just four lawmakers who opposed a bill prohibiting the display of swastikas and other hate symbols on private property without the owner’s consent. Additionally, in 2014, Parrott voted against a state budget amendment condemning antisemitism as “an intolerable and ugly form of bigotry,” and denouncing academic boycotts of Israel – a move widely criticized by leaders across Maryland.\n\n###\n\nUp Next\n\nApril McClain Delaney Launches New Campaign Ad “Protect”\n\nContribute Now\n\nDonate to the Campaign!\n\nWe've launched our campaign and are looking for your support!
