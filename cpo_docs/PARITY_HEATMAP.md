# Markup–Prose Parity Heatmap

- **Score** blends required (70%) and optional (30%) coverage.
- **Colors**:
  - Red: < 60% — critical gaps (usually missing headline/subtype/date or Event/CTA for subtype).
  - Amber: 60–89% — acceptable but add evidence/endorser/location/CTA lines.
  - Green: ≥ 90% — strong parity; still run the linter for evidence counts and domains.
- **Placement Hints**:
  - headline: top line or first sentence block.
  - lede: after the opening paragraph.
  - body: mid-article context.
  - close: final paragraph (CTA, donation, RSVP).
